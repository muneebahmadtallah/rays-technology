            <p class="text-justify ">The New DV2T Viscometer features a 5-inch color display to guide users through test creation and data gathering for 
                fast and easy viscosity measurements. The DV2T also offers powerful new programming capabilities and results analysis 
                including data averaging and QC limits with alarms. User instructions with multi-step test protocols can be created using 
                the new Program Generator Software and uploaded to the DV2T through a USB Flash Drive (both included with instrument).
                 Test Data can be recorded directly on a local
                 printer or sent to a PC. Additional automated control and data collection can be achieved with optional RheocalcT software. </p>
